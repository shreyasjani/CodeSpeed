The American entrepreneur, philanthropist and the Chairman of Microsoft, was
born on 28th October, 1955 into a wealthy Seattle family. His father was a
prominent attorney and mother, a bank board member. A story goes that, at his
birth, his father set-up a million-dollar fund for him. But, Gates denied it. But one
thing that is for sure, is that he had the best of education, including 3 years at
Harvard.
As a student, Gates excelled in elementary school, particularly in Mathematics
and Sciences. At 13, he was enrolled in the Lakeside School, Seattle’s most
exclusive preparatory school. When he was in the eighth grade, the school
mothers used proceeds’ from Lakeside’s rummage sale to buy an ASR-33
teletype terminal and a block of computer time in a General Electric Computer.
Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC and was
excused from Maths classes to pursue his interest. After the Mothers’ Club
donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on other systems,
including DEC PDP minicomputer. One of these systems was a PDP-10
belonging to Computer Centre Corporation, which banned the Lakeside students
for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to
obtain free computer time.
